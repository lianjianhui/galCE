Galaxy chemical evolution code

This script is written to predict the chemical evolution of elemental abundances in gas, individual stars and synthetic stellar populations in the Milky Way and galaxies. It currently includes sources of metals from AGB stars, Core-collapse supernovae, and type-Ia supernovae. Neutron star mergers and magneto-rotating supernovae are to be included.
