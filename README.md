Galaxy chemical evolution code

This script is written to predict the chemical evolution of elemental abundances in gas, individual stars and synthetic stellar populations in the Milky Way and galaxies based on [Lian et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474.1143L/abstract), [Lian et al. 202a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.2561L/abstract), [Lian et al. 2020b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.2371L/abstract) and [Lian et al. 2020c](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.3557L/abstract). It currently includes sources of metals from AGB stars, Core-collapse supernovae, and type-Ia supernovae. Neutron star mergers and magneto-rotating supernovae are to be included. A multi-phase of gas accretion and star formation histories based on Lian et al. 2020b and Lian et al. 2020c are adopted at the moment. We are working to include more generic (e.g., exponential declining) histories. Please stay tuned for updates! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me (732592593@qq.com). 

If this code is used for your study, please cite Lian et al. 2018 in case of extra-galactic work or Lian et al. 2020 for Galactic work.
